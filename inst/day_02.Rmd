TODO:
- Format for game data 
- Reformat to fit game data

What am I to consider an **observation**? -- One round of one game (has features GAME, RED, GREEN, BLUE, ROUND). 

```{r}
games <- readLines(con = here::here('data', 'day_02'))
```

```{r}
names(games) <- 1:100
```
```{r}
games <- stringr::str_remove_all(string = games, pattern = 'Game \\d+: ')
```
```{r}
rounds <- stringr::str_split(string = games, pattern = '; ')
```

```{r}
count_color <- \(vec) {
  res <- c(red = 0, blue = 0, green = 0)
  
}
```
